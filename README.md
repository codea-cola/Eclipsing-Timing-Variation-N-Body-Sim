# Eclipsing-Timing-Variation-N-Body-Sim
Simulate Eclipsing Timing Variations for N Body Systems

# Eclipsing Timing Variation Simulator

This Python application provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for simulating Eclipsing 
Timing Variation (ETV) in a three-body star-planet system. The program allows you to explore how the presence of a third body (planet) affects the observed timing of eclipsing binary star systems.
